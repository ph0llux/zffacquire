# Installation

First, you need to [install rust and cargo](https://rustup.rs/) to build or install ```zffacquire```.
Then you can easily build this tool yourself by using cargo:
```bash
[/home/ph0llux/projects/zffacquire] $ cargo build --release
```
Or you can install the tool directly from crates.io:
```bash
$ cargo install zffacquire
```

# Planned features until zffacquire reaches version 1.0
- Keyfile support for encryption
- impl Error handling @zffacquire if IoError->Interupt.
